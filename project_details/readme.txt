# Next-Gen Railway Track Monitoring and Control Using IoT

## Overview
The **Next-Gen Railway Track Monitoring and Control Using IoT** project uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor and control railway track conditions in real-time. The system integrates sensors to provide crucial data on track conditions, helping in efficient management, maintenance, and ensuring the safety of railway operations.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks the condition of railway tracks using IoT sensors.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends alerts for critical conditions detected on the tracks.
- **Web Interface**: A simple PHP-based web interface to visualize the track data and monitor sensor statuses.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides an intuitive dashboard to analyze track conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **PHP Server**: This project requires a PHP server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP).
- **IoT Sensors**: The project involves IoT sensors for monitoring track conditions (refer to the project kit).
- **Web Browser**: For viewing the web interface.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Next-Gen-Railway-Track-Monitoring-and-Control-Using-IoT.git
   \`\`\`

2. **Set up the PHP server**:
   - Navigate to the \`coding/\` directory and ensure \`index.php\` is hosted on a PHP server.
   - If using XAMPP, place the project in the \`htdocs\` folder and access it through your local server (e.g., \`http://localhost/Next-Gen-Railway-Track-Monitoring-and-Control-Using-IoT/coding/index.php\`).

3. **Set up IoT Sensors**:
   - Follow the setup instructions in the \`report_of_project.pdf\` for connecting and configuring the IoT sensors that monitor the railway tracks.
   
4. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your web browser and go to the provided URL to view the railway track monitoring dashboard.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can view the live data of railway track conditions. The web interface will show:
- Track status (Good, Warning, Critical)
- Temperature and humidity readings from the sensors
- Alerts for critical track conditions

## Example Output
The web page will display the track information, such as:

- **Track 1**: Status: Good, Temperature: 25°C, Humidity: 60%
- **Track 2**: Status: Warning, Temperature: 30°C, Humidity: 70%
- **Track 3**: Status: Critical, Temperature: 35°C, Humidity: 80%

Alerts will be shown if the track is in a "Critical" or "Warning" state.
