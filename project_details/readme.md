# 🚄 Next-Gen Railway Track Monitoring and Control Using IoT

A real-time IoT-based system designed to detect railway track faults and send alerts to improve train safety, reduce accidents, and enable predictive maintenance. This smart solution integrates sensors, GPS, and cloud platforms to monitor tracks and notify authorities instantly in case of irregularities.

---

## 🧾 Abstract

This project proposes a novel method for detecting irregularities in railway tracks by updating fault data to the cloud in real-time. The **IoT-Based Railway Track Monitoring System (IoT-RMS)** identifies cracks and faults using sensors embedded in train engines, enabling early-stage detection and accident prevention.

Once a fault is detected, the system alerts the **train driver to apply emergency brakes** and sends precise **GPS-based location data** to railway authorities. It also **shares fault data with other trains** to prevent chain collisions or delays. The system uses a **hybrid localization method** to function effectively even in **low GPS signal zones**. 

Given that Indian Railways is one of the world's largest railway networks, this system aims to **reduce casualties**, **minimize manual inspections**, and **lower operational costs** while contributing to a safer, smarter transportation infrastructure.
